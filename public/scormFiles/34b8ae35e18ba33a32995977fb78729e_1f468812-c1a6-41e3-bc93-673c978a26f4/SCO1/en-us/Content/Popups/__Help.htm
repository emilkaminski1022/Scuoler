								<h3>How to Use The Course</h3>
								<p>The course player is designed with 3 main areas: the banner at the top, the main 
                                    content area and the navigation and a footer at the bottom of the player window. 
                                    The banner contains information about the course and the current location within 
                                    it (if the author has chosen to provide that information there) as well as a 
                                    menu to access additional player capabilities such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Help.</b> You're reading it now.</li>
                                    <li><b>Table of contents.</b> This will show you the overall course structure, allow you to go to a different part of the course and give you a sense of your overall progress.</li>
                                    <li><b>Resources (if available).</b> Provides a central location for links to additional resources found throughout the course that may enrich your learning on a particular subject.</li>
                                    <li><b>Change Language (if available).</b> Provides the ability to change the language version of the player and content if it has been localized to one or more languages.</li>
                                    <li><b>Change Tracks (if available).</b> Sometimes authors take long courses and organize them into smaller parts so that you can take the portions that are relevant to you. These are called tracks, and usually you choose them prior to starting to take the training. If they allow you to change your mind after you started, this is how you'd do it.</li>
                                    <li><b>Download (if available).</b> Downloads the course to the Access Point Offline Player</li>
                                    <li><b>Glossary (if available).</b> Provides definitions of terms found in the course.</li>

								<h3>Navigation using the keyboard</h3>
                                <p>All actionable items in the player or content pages should support receiving the focus and be part of the tab order. In addition, the player provides several keystroke combinations to allow users to navigate without the use of a mouse. The table below contains the list of supported keyboard shortcuts. Screen reader users may be required to instruct the screen reader to pass the keystrokes through to the browser to overcome any conflict with the screen reader keyboard shortcuts.</p>
                                <table>
                                <tr><th style="text-align:left;width:70%;padding-right:.5%;">Player Feature</th><th style="text-align:left;">Keyboard Shortcut</th></tr>
                                <tr><td>Play or Pause Audio and Video</td><td>CTRL + ALT + P</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Navigate to Previous Page</td><td>CTRL + ALT + B</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Navigate to Next Page</td><td>CTRL + ALT + N</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Turn on Accessible Mode for drag and drop </td><td>CTRL + ALT + A</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Send Focus to the Content Area </td><td>CTRL + ALT + K</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Close a Modal Dialog (for example Help)</td><td>Esc</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Make a choice in an Assessment Question</td><td>Spacebar</td></tr>
                                </table>
                                <h3>Screen Reader Support</h3>
                                <p>The player has implemented a visually hidden area at the top of each content page to provide screen reader users hints regarding the content on the page and what is expected to complete the page. This visually hidden may also contain the relevant portions of the content from the page re-organized to eliminate the need to navigate around the page to activate visual elements. It also includes shortcut links to assist with navigation through the course. </p>
                                <h3>Text Sizing</h3>
                                <p>The player was implemented using an approach that will automatically resize the fonts as the browser window size increases. To increase font size, hit the F11 key to go full screen. To further increase font size you may also increase the browser zoom level (this may cause scroll bars to appear). </p>
                                <h3>Closed Captions and Transcripts</h3>
                                <p>All instances of audio and video are capable of providing either closed captions or a transcript (or both). Audio player captions are on automatically. Use the transcript button on the audio player to open a transcript window for page audio. Use the video player's closed caption or transcript button to use those capabilties when video is playing.</p>
                                <h3>Alternate Text for Images</h3>
                                <p>Content authors are responsible for providing alternate text for images used in the course. All images used as buttons by built-in course functions have alternate text to indicate their purpose. </p>

							<a href="#">Navigation Issues</a>
							<div class="help_topic_content">

								<p>Some courses require that you go through the course in a specific order. In order to accomplish this, authors can enable a linear navigation restriction to force users to go through the pages in order.</p>
                                <p>When linear navigation is in place, you need to complete each page entirely prior to moving forward. If you try to navigate away from a page before that page tells the course it is done, you will see an error telling you to finish the page. What you need to do will vary based on the page you are on:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Video Pages</b>. These may be set to require you to watch the entire video, and may have the fast forward (scrubber bar) disabled. Watch the video to complete the page.</li>
                                <li><b>Content pages</b>. These pages take a variety of styles, but some require you to click a series of tiles, tabs or images on the screen to see, read or hear information. </li>
                                <li><b>Assessments</b>. If the course contains a knowledge check or test, you may need answer all the questions or reach a certain passing percentage in order to continue. </li>

							<div class="help_topic_content">
								<p>We try our best to give everyone a good playback experience for video, but it's not always easy. There are many factors that go into having a good experience with media (including having good media to start with). Assuming the video itself isn't choppy, you can try the following:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Download the video and try it locally.</b> If the author used the wrong encoding settings and lowered the frame rate too low, you might be watching a choppy video and not having bandwidth issues.</li>
                                <li><b>Download the course and try it locally.</b> If the author enabled the course to be taken offline, you can download the course using the "Quick Links" menu and use Access Point Offline Player to take the course. This will bring a copy of the course down to your machine and take the network out of the mix. Be sure to reconnect to corpnet and synchronize your results when finished to get credit. </li>
                                <li><b>Select a lower quality video.</b> If you see a quality button, choose a lower quality video and see if that helps. If you don't see a quality button, the author didn't provide one or you're using smooth streaming, which if that isn't working for you that's a problem we should know about.

This will allow smooth streaming to be used (if provided by the author) and could result in a better video experience. </li>
                                <li><b>Use a wired connection</b>. If you're on corpnet, and are using wireless to play video, try switching to a wired connection. </li>

								<p>The page loads, there is a box where video should be, but the video isn't playing at all. Maybe there is an error message, maybe not. This could be a video driver issue. Here are some things to try:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Switch to software rendering (IE9+)</b>. In the browser, go to Internet Options (the gear looking thingy or the Tools | Internet Options menu), open that up and go to the advanced tab.

                                <li><b>Unplug the USB Device</b>. This is rare, but it happens. Sometimes Silverlight has issues with USB devices used by folks to listen to audio. We've seen it fix itself by simply unplugging your headphones or speakers if they are connected via a USB port and then plug them back in.</li>

                                <li><b>Click the link to try downloading the video (part 1).</b> There should be a link on the error page to try to download the video to your local machine. If the link doesn't end with an actual video file name, like "MyCoolVideo.mp4" something is messed up in the course configuration and we blame the author.

Let it finish, then try to play it off your machine (wherever it stored it) using a video player on your machine. If it plays, you have the necessary software (codecs) to play that type of video. If it doesn't, then you need to get those codecs or switch to a browser that supports Silverlight.</li>

If you have both built-in speakers and headphones, make sure that the sound is supposed to play through the right one. In your task tray (lower right of your screen), you should see a volume looking icon. Right click that, choose playback devices, and make sure the default device for playback is what you think it is. If it is, then close that window, left click on the same icon, and go to the Mixer. Look for the browser and make sure that the volume is turned up. </li>

								<p>This can be a bit complicated. The player doesn't require plug-ins, unless of course it requires plug-ins, then you need them. The  player is designed to use as few plug-ins as possible to provide the greatest support across different Windows OS versions. In order to support things like being embedded in a Windows 8 application or played in the IE10 Modern browser, media playback is done through HTML5 video if possible. However, in order to support things like IE8 (which doesn't support HTML5 video tags), we need Silverlight to play media. Content authors also may have added content that requires other plugins (although in courses destined for Learning Central this is technically prohibited), and if they have added Silverlight or Flash content you'll need to have whatever they require.</p>
								<p>With that in mind, the basic information about what we require or have tested against is below.</p>
                                <h3>Video (and content in general)</h3>
								<p>For optimum viewing set screen resolution to 1024 by 768 or higher, zoom at 100% or lower.</p>

                                We're Microsoft, so of course we'd like you to be using Microsoft® Internet Explorer. We encourage you to update to the latest IE version available for your OS. The browser must be configured to run Active X® controls and plug-ins. The full list of browser support is:
