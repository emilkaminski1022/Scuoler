													<p>Anyone who has access to your computer can steal it or its components. With the popularity of portable
													computers such as laptops, physical theft of computers has become very common.</p>

													<p>You can become a victim of virtual theft when your computer is connected to the Internet. An example
													of virtual theft is identity theft. Identity theft happens when someone, usually a hacker, steals your
													personal information and uses it without your permission to assume your identity. The hacker then uses
													your identity to gain access to your finances or perform illegal actions. In this way, the hacker can
													damage your reputation.</p>

													<p>Another example of virtual theft is software piracy, which is theft of a computer design or program. 
													Software piracy also refers to the unauthorized distribution and use of a computer program or 
													confidential documents.</p>

													<p>Viruses, worms, and trojan horses are computer programs that can damage the data or software on
													your computer, or steal the information stored on your computer.</p>
													
													<p>A virus is a malicious program (also called malware) that makes copies of itself and then inserts those
													copies into other programs or data files on your computer or on your hard drive. Viruses can reach your
													computer, without your knowledge, through the Internet or storage devices, such as disks and CD-
													ROMs.</p>

													<p>A worm is a stand-alone malicious computer program that replicates itself with the goal of spreading the
													original code to other computers, usually through computer networks. This can cause harm by
													consuming bandwidth or possibly deleting files or sent documents.</p>

													<p>A trojan horse is a type of malicious software that appears to be harmless but that contains hidden code 
													designed to exploit or damage your computer. Unlike worms, trojan horses do not have the ability to 
													replicate, but after they are installed, they infect additional files on your system. They can even send
													information from your computer to the developer of the malware over the Internet, which allows the 
													developer to control aspects of your system. This can lead to stolen data, installation of more malware, 
													the recording of your keystrokes (called key logging), and other illegal actions.</p>
