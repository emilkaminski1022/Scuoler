** This file is part of the ADL Sample API Implementation intended to provide
** an elementary example of the concepts presented in the ADL Sharable
** Content Object Reference Model (SCORM).
**
** The purpose in wrapping the calls to the API is to (1) provide a
** consistent means of finding the LMS API implementation within the window
** hierarchy and (2) to validate that the data being exchanged via the
** API conforms to the defined CMI data types.
**
** This is just one possible example for implementing the API guidelines for
** runtime communication between an LMS and executable content components.
** There are several other possible implementations.
