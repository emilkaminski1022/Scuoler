										Backing up data involves creating multiple copies of your data and saving them either to an external hard drive or to an online backup site in the cloud. Events like floods and earthquakes can occur without warning. Regularly backing up your data minimizes the impact of these threats, because even if your original data is lost, you have copies that you can recover by using any computer. To provide better recoverability, keep a copy of your important data in a location that is physically separate from your computer, such as in a different building.<br />
