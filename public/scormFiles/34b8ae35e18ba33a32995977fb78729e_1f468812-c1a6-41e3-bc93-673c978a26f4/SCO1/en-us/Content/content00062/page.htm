										<p>Encryption is a way to improve the security of a message or file by scrambling its contents. Only 
										someone who has the correct encryption key can unscramble and read the contents of those messages
										and files. To prevent lost, stolen, or hacked documents and files from being readable, you can encrypt 
										data by using encryption software such as Microsoft BitLocker (for your hard drive) and BitLocker To Go 
										(for removable drives such as your USB drive).</p>
										
										<p>Bitlocker is compatible with Vista Enterprise, Vista Ultimate, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 and 
										Windows Server R2. BitLocker does not encrypt hard drives that have Windows XP, Windows 2000, or
										Windows 2003 installed.</p>
										
										<p>BitLocker helps protect you from both online and offline attacks. In an offline attack, a malicious user 
										takes the hard drive from your computer and connects it to another computer for the purpose of 
										extracting your data.</p>

										<!-- Page Description -->
										<p>When using the Internet, you might be vulnerable to spyware or viruses that can greatly damage your 
										computer. It is important to download an antivirus and antispyware program that can prevent and 
										remove the viruses. Antivirus and antispyware programs that are present in the computer’s memory can 
										alert you to the presence of a virus in your system and prevent viruses from entering. You must regularly 
										update these programs on your system, because the programs are revised when new viruses and 
										spyware are discovered. These updates will further protect your computer. Most programs offer an 
										automatic update feature that automatically installs the updated version of the program.</p>

										<p>Because the source of many viruses, spyware, and trojan horses are email sources and email software,
										Microsoft Outlook has features that allow you to block junk email messages; filter messages from 
										viruses, Trojan horses, and spyware; and scan your attachments for malware.</p>

										<p>Windows 8 has a free, built-in feature called Windows Defender that helps protect your computer 
										against pop-ups, slow performance, and security threats caused by viruses, spyware, and other 
										malicious software. Windows Defender runs in the background, meaning it is constantly working to 
										detect and warn you of suspicious programs or activity, but you can also manually scan your computer 
										for threats at any time.</p>
										
										<p>Microsoft SmartScreen Filter is another new, built-in safety feature in Windows 8 and Windows RT (the 
										Windows 8 operating system designed for mobile devices and tablets). SmartScreen Filter helps protect 
										your computer by warning you if a downloaded file is known to be malware or has an unknown 
										reputation. SmartScreen Filter features antiphishing protection, download manager protection, 
										application reputation, and antimalware protection.</p>

										<!-- Page Description -->
										<p>Another effective step you can take to protect against malicious threats is to install a firewall. A firewall 
										prevents unauthorized access to a private network that is connected to the Internet. It forms a barrier 
										between trusted and untrusted websites. You can configure your firewall in two different ways: to use a 
										default-deny policy or to use a default-allow policy. A default-deny policy allows only the listed network 
										services. A default-allow policy blocks only the listed network services, and accepts everything else. 
										Windows 8 comes with Windows Firewall, which blocks unwanted access to your computer.</p>

										<p>A firewall does not protect you from all viruses, so it is necessary to also install an antivirus or 
										antimalware app. Windows Defender can help protect you against viruses that your firewall does not 
										protect you from.</p>

										<p>You might lose your data from accidental deletion or destruction. You can back up important computer

										<p>To back up your data, right-click the Start button, click Control Panel, click System and Security, and then

										and what information you want to back up. If you have backed up your information before, you can wait

										<p>It is good idea to back up your information regularly so that you always have a current copy of your files
										and programs in case you need to restore your data. It is best to back up your data to multiple sources,
										such as to an external hard drive and to a CD. This ensures you have a second backup copy of your data
