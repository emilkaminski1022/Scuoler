									By using the Internet extensively,  you have the potential to get involved in illegal and unethical 
									activities, such as gambling or damaging somebody’s reputation. You need to be aware of and cautious 
									of these illegal and unethical practices. Remember that the way these practices are defined varies in 
									different countries/regions, and even within parts of a single country/region, and that the legal system is 
									different in different states and countries/regions.<br>

								3. Synched navigation (include attribute data-navigation="synched" on tab_container): no user revealing of tabs; tab revealing is synchronized with page media 
								When using synched navigation, data-startTime and data-endTime attributes should be included on the tabs -->

												<!-- Tab Content Description -->
													<p>When you communicate with others by using email, chat rooms, or online public forums, be careful not 
													to make any statements about anyone that may result in defamation. Defamation means making false 
													statements about a person that can negatively affect the person’s reputation. For example, suppose you 
													post a message on an online forum falsely stating that your neighbor is running an illegal business. This 
													would be considered defamation, because you are spreading false information that may harm your 
													neighbor’s credibility.</p> 

													<p>Libel and slander are two forms of defamation. Libel means written defamation that has been published, 
													whereas slander means verbal defamation. The legal system of most countries/regions considers both 
													libel and slander as punishable offenses. You may face criminal or civil penalties according to the legal 
													system of your country/region. The punishment may range from a monetary penalty to severe 
													punishment such as jail terms. Sometimes, the severity of the offense depends on the situation. For 
													example, in some countries/regions, any insult to the President is a criminal offense. Therefore, be 
													aware of the local laws before making any defamatory statements.</p>

													<b>Note:</b>                   
													A false statement can be considered defamatory, even if it is not derogatory. Sometimes, even true statements can be considered defamatory if the statements harm someone’s reputation.

												<!-- Tab Content Description -->
													<p>Some websites offer services that carry out activities that are restricted by the legal system of your state 
													or country/region. It is possible to access these sites over the Internet, because the Internet has no 
													boundaries or police. For example, you can access a gambling site even if the law of your country/region 
													bans gambling, however, this may cause legal troubles for you.</p>

													<p>The issue of conducting illegal activity on websites also applies to the buying and selling of products on 
													the Internet. For example, the products that you can legally buy or sell in one country/region might be 
													considered an illegal purchase or sale in another country/region. Although a website might not restrict 
													you from buying an item that is illegal in your country/region, you might face legal charges for buying 
													the item.</p>
